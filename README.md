# Welcome to Soufflé-Prov!

This fork adds semiring-based provenance capabilities to the [Soufflé](https://souffle-lang.github.io) language project.
Currently, only 0-closed totally ordered semirings (aka. Dijkstra's semirings) are covered, but one could also extend to distributive lattices.

More information can be found in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01132).

# Legacy welcoming from Soufflé

The Soufflé language is similar to Datalog (but has terms known as records), and is frequently used as a
domain-specific language for analysis problems.

## Features of Soufflé

*   Efficient translation to parallel C++ of Datalog programs
*   Efficient interpretation
*   Extended semantics of Datalog, e.g., permitting unbounded recursions with numbers and terms
*   Simple component model for Datalog specifications
*   Recursively defined record types (aka. constructors) for tuples
